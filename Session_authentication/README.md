# Session authentication

This project demonstrates the implementation of session authentication in Python using Flask. The goal is to understand the session authentication process, which is often used to manage user sessions in web applications. This project is a hands-on learning exercise to understand the underlying mechanisms of session authentication, cookies, and how to securely store and manage session data.

## Background Context

In this project, you will implement a  **Session Authentication**. You are not allowed to install any other module.

In the industry, you should  **not**  implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask:  [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/X_Ss7um7S0h2y62_R5U5jQ "Flask-HTTPAuth")). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/N7kCrbRr7O0pfv8oVVzynw "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What authentication means
-   What session authentication means
-   What Cookies are
-   How to send Cookies
-   How to parse Cookies

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using  `python3`  (version 3.9)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly  `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the  `pycodestyle`  style (version 2.5)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using  `wc`
-   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
-   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
-   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`  and  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
-   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
